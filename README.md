# FanDuel take-home

This app is made in React, TypeScript, Redux, styled-components and reselect.
This example is following the [Ducks pattern](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) when manipulating with Redux.

- `components` folder contains reusable components. 
- `pages` folder contains one page - game page.
- `game` folder contains reducers, selectors and actions for the game. This folder could be later under `ducks` folder.
